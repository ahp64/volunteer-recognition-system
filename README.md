This is the read me for our website, "The Volunteer Reward and Recognition System".

The Volunteer Reward and Recognition System will allow UF student organizations to manage their volunteers by tracking volunteer hours, rewarding top contributors, and encouraging participation.
They will be rewarded with recognition systems like badges, leaderboards, or certificates.
The system will also let users register, log in, and view their profiles, which will display valuable information.
